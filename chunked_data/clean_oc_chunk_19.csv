For that reason alone, the games are well-worth engaging in - but the tactical combat is still a draw too, scratching the itch for challenging content with plenty of rewarding eureka moments for those willing to spend time within them.

The story has a meaning and even though the story feels a little bit extravagant due to its original way of narration you can’t simply leave the story untold. Characters including Sherlock and Jon are well-written and even though some character acts strangely or you just don’t like them, there is always some reason behind the behavior. The open-world is the game’s general pride, but it mostly feels empty despite having something to offer. On the other hand, the absence of map and navigation gives a gentle touch to its detective gameplay. Luckily, everything bad is suppressed by everything great the game has to offer.

A free narrative is deliberately created here, which could playfully offer undeniable new opportunities, but narrative balances on a fine line between emotion-free narrative structure and individualizable adventure. In this breakneck balancing act, Watch Dogs: Legion loses itself in a sober, generic narrative that, due to its pale character drawings and the playful omissions that accompany them, was never really allowed to keep up with its predecessors. Thanks to interchangeable characters, an unbalanced skill system and redundant game elements, Ubisoft is only marginally able to continuously exploit the potential behind the new unique selling point. Instead, the hacker IP gets lost in a jumble of well-intentioned but half-baked game approaches that ultimately fail to prove themselves on a motivational level. The manifold solution options as well as the tricky level structures should, however, at least provide for entertaining gaming fun. Despite the new approach, Ubisoft simply doesn't risk enough to really step out of the worn out, playful structures of its predecessors and burden the game principle with a little more relevance and ""unconsumption"".

That being said, I'm not entirely sure I can recommend the Switch be your vehicle to explore the town of Mundaun. The short render distance and constant shadow pop-in can be very distracting and does detract from the game's atmosphere; a brief period with the game's PC release seemed to indicate that these issues are unique to the Switch.
