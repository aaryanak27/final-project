The lack of level variety is an issue, however I enjoyed every single fight thanks to the varied and deep combat. With three stances, five weapon types, skills, ninjutsu, and magic, it’s hard to get bored during a fifty to sixty-hour campaign and you’ll likely jump straight into new game plus without stopping for breath. Team Ninja set its sights high with Nioh, seeking to create a samurai-inspired Soulsborne game, with a distinct personality and combat style.

That being said, Nioh filled a gap in my heart of tough but rewarding gameplay whilst I wait for the latest Dark Souls DLC to come out, and I'm also confident that Nioh is a game I will keep coming back to for a long time.
If you have a Playstation 4, I will happily go on record with saying that Nioh is an essential game for your library, the stunning visuals, gripping story, and solid gameplay makes the game stand out from a lot of the competition. Whilst I do say it deserves to be merited on its own achievements, for me, it is the game that came closest to encapsulating the feel of the Souls series and Bloodborne, and feels so much more polished than games like Lords of the Fallen.

The director has been outspoken that the initial seed of Doki Doki Literature Club from his “love/hate” relationship with anime and VNs.

Analyse every screenshot and video and yes, you'll spot visual downgrades when compared to the other console editions, but what's key here is that the spirit of the game has been transferred perfectly, with the added benefit of portable play which opens up the chance to host local matches with your Switch owning mates wherever and whenever you fancy. Developer Panic Button has done an utterly fantastic job with this port, but technical wizardry aside, what really matters is that the core game is so addictive, so compelling, so enjoyable and – perhaps above all else – so deep. Don't let anyone tell you that Rocket League is simplistic or lacks longevity; the vibrant community that has grown up around Psyonix's masterpiece renders that viewpoint wholly incorrect. This is a game that rewards skilful play and perseverance, and new tactics and strategies seem to flow from each and every match you partake in.
