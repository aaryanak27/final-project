From PUGB and Fortnite to Call of Duty, Apex and more, there is a tried and tested formula that seems to reign supreme. So when I saw a code of an (as of that moment) unreleased online multiplayer called Tannenberg come along, I was certainly intrigued.

Now, it wasn’t that online multiplayer aspect that caught my attention, but rather, the setting. A WWI game, a part of history that video games tend to overlook in favour of WWII, Vietnam, or more modern fictional wars. I knew nothing more about the game when I agreed to take the code, and that is just the way I like it. So, how did I find my time in the trenches? Did I go over the top for glory or was I left with underpants on my head, pencils up my nose crying wibble in the hope of being sent home?

https://chalgyr.com/2020/11/review-ps5-nba2k21.html

November 20, 2020

NBA 2K21 is generally a great way to usher in the new generation of consoles. The visuals and The City are a big step in the right direction. Some lessons were learned from the earlier release of NBA 2K21 on the last-gen consoles, and that made this a much smoother release experience. That being said, I still can’t shake the feeling I got during my initial review of this title on Xbox One a couple of months ago, that the development team was spread thin between prepping this title for two platforms and the release issues that I’ve encountered only reinforce that issue. Basketball fans will find lots to like here, even though there are some rough patches to be worked out.

September 11, 2020

In all, NBA 2k21 is still the best sports experience on the market. That being said, this feels like a strange year for the series, given the pandemic, altered real life NBA season and split attention between two generations of console. There were few significant changes made, but almost all of those updates were for the better – except arguably the most important one. To change such a core mechanic as shooting so fundamentally is going to be polarizing and while I have been growing used to how it works, I think more tweaks need to be made to finetune the experience. 

It’s been a strange year and NBA 2k21 reflects that in a lot of ways. All things considered however, NBA 2K20 was easily my most played video game over the last year and I suspect that will be the case for my upcoming year and NBA 2K21.",2020-11-20T00:00:00.000Z,False,e31321db733a40d29cc0640b524dfa00

There is a lot of promise when the game starts out, and between the intense mood and solid survival mechanics, it seems like there might actually be a good time in store. However, in the sixty or seventy hours that follow, disappointment slowly builds until the whole adventure ends with a pitiful thud. The combat is dreadfully boring, and there are so many bad ideas that work against its core survival mechanic that it is a wonder the game stays interesting as long as it does.

There's a hardcore fanbase out there that loves this game, but there's an exceptionally high learning and enjoyment curve that will keep more casual players from getting invested enough to explore its deepest content or even wade around much in the shallow end. On a quality level, the game simply doesn't feel like it made it out of early access even though this is the full release. Add that the game is hardly optimized for controller and living room TV play, and this is a title that is hard to recommend outright. That said, for fans of survival games, there's a very intriguing game layered underneath walls, road bumps, and cliffs that need to be scaled to get there.

The game works well with high resolutions, ultrawide configurations, and high refresh rates.

5efa0591d88e035744c18dd9,Nintendo Life,PJ O'Reilly,60.0,"Blair Witch starts off strong, throwing its players into a setting that comes with some pretty terrifying baggage for anyone who's familiar with the film upon which it is based. It's got a handful of fun mechanics, including the absolute star of the show, Bullet, and its story comes on strong towards the end, injecting the final third with some real tension. However, this is also a game that plods along for the most part, making no real use of its spooky setting, instead hemming players into small areas and forcing them to partake in a string of simplistic and rather hackneyed puzzles and busywork at the expense of any real tension. Overall then, Blair Witch is something of a mixed bag; it's not the worst horror game we've played recently, but it also doesn't do enough to earn a hearty recommendation.",2020-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,True,8b62502ac3774dd5b43e208bb2a46ef3

I got my first successful run after about three hours of playtime, which depending on what kind of player you are could be seen as a good thing or a bad thing, though personally it felt a tad too short to me. Overall The Red Lantern is worth your time if you have an interest in the outdoors, a lust for adventure in the unknown, or just want to pet some fluffy sled dogs.",2020-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,True,8a1b0c496c5440cfa71ba276c75a8aa4

It was easily one of my most anticipated games of the year but it just didn't live up to my expectations. In many ways, I think it had interesting ideas that just weren't executed well.

Its unique blend of multiple genres feels unique and where survival elements in most games grow tiresome quickly, they sit perfectly within this Alaskan journey of new beginnings.

But I'm not sure the roguelite style stays fresh all the way through, and it can get a bit tiring and repetitive. In the end, The Red Lantern is not going to win a lot of awards for what it does and is, but it's a unique take on the walking simulator genre that honestly has gotten stale and oversaturated.",2020-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,True,8a1b0c496c5440cfa71ba276c75a8aa4

These things help to separate Rogue Lords from the pack, but unfortunately some uneven difficulty spikes and combat’s pacing slowing down in later runs takes a bit of the shine off the game’s longevity. It’s still worth playing until that happens.",2022-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,False,0b477a53fac049f9aaac1b5bd84e56a1
6280e61d008489e208d91372,Thumb Culture,Gareth Trueman,80.0,Rogue Lords is that it’s a fun strategy game and the characters being horror legends just tops it off. Especially if you’re a horror fan like myself.,2022-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,False,0b477a53fac049f9aaac1b5bd84e56a1
62794a1c008489e208d8e802,ThisGenGaming,Justin Oneil,75.0,Rogue Lords is another solid roguelike game for fans of the genre but one that also has some issues with RNG and repetitiveness. I really dug the art style and voice acting but the gameplay doesn’t hold up as well over the long haul of these chapters. Altering things in your favor though with the risk/reward essence mechanic did feel pretty unique though and I don’t regret my time playing the game at all. If you’re a fan of the genre and don’t mind it feeling a little unfair at times then you’ll likely enjoy this.,2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,True,0b477a53fac049f9aaac1b5bd84e56a1
62790c48008489e208d8e3ee,Pure Nintendo,Ted Hazell,55.0,"Rogue Lords is very pretty. They nailed the art design and character models, which I imagine will attract many people to this roguelike RPG. However, I am afraid that the attraction is surface level. With any roguelike game, you expect each run to feel different from the next and reset that excitement and engagement. Still, with Rogue Lords, once you've completed three books or so, it doesn't feel like it has any more to offer. Getting through three books is an achievement, as the gameplay and battle system is tedious, hard and repetitive. With a bit more streamlining of some mechanics and improvements in pacing, you'll have a more polished title that I'd be more comfortable recommending.",2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,True,0b477a53fac049f9aaac1b5bd84e56a1
62728c57008489e208d8bd8b,GameSpew,Richard Seagrave,60.0,"Rogue Lords, then, isn’t a roguelike for the masses. And even those keen on the genre might not gel with it. The long-term rewards just aren’t all that rewarding, especially with each run feeling like a slog. And while its unique mechanics separate it from its peers, they also overcomplicate matters. Still, its horror theme is definitely alluring, so roguelike fans who like a bit of darkness might want to give it a go.",2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,True,0b477a53fac049f9aaac1b5bd84e56a1

There’s a constant one-more-encounter compulsivity as you look to make your band of villains ever more powerful, and a huge scope for creativity provided by the reality-bending devil mode.

61adef4dd3d48c5c6a071243,Area Xbox,Kevin Arbelo,77.0,"Rogue Lords is a game to take into account for lovers of the genre. And it is the work of Leikir Studio and Nacon. It mixes very well the bases of the roguelike titles with a whole breath of fresh air such as the fact of putting ourselves in the role of the baddie.

Unfortunately, as it stands, Rogue Lords suffers significantly from its lack of balance and the repetitive nature of both runs and combat. It can be difficult to strategize when RNG constantly feels stacked against the player, and being forced to restart a book after a surprise, impossible boss fight is demoralizing. With some retuning, however, Rogue Lords could better capitalize on its great ideas and innovate for the roguelike genre.",2021-10-13T00:00:00.000Z,True,0b477a53fac049f9aaac1b5bd84e56a1
