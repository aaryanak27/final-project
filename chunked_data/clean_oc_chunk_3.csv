5e91f071bdf729557ef48269,LadiesGamers.com,James Luff,80.0,"Initially I was warmed by the retro inspired pixel graphics and music. Dandara dares to be different and it just works. Crazy difficulty spikes made the later areas of the game quite frustrating. Regardless, I can’t deny I still had a lot of fun and the game made me look up some history which is good in my books. As I returned to replay the game I thought about the real Dandara and her struggle to fight against an incredibly difficult cause for the time. While the fight against slavery doesn’t compare to the the struggle of finishing a video game. I spent around two hours fighting the final boss before I succeeded. The lesson I guess I picked up from this is never give up no matter what. You can make it through.",2020-03-26T00:00:00.000Z,False,a5dbe3de0fb14e029d78f85b25e89ca6

These are all ridiculous justifications for playing a game I knew early on I disliked.

I want to rant and rave about all the puzzles I solved, I want to convene with others and pick their brains over the challenging ones, I want to describe in vast detail the great variety of challenges The Witness presents. But all of this would do a disservice to The Witness; a truly marvelous game which, to the curious problem solver, simply must be played.

I attempted to see what was so ""mindtwisting,"" ""transcendental,"" or how it provokes ""natural epiphanies."" I just couldn't though. All I saw were endless line puzzles which felt like endless padding, like the creation of the island itself was as far as the developer got in planning and then realized they had to have some sort of driving mechanism to justify it. The depressing thing about it all is that it's such a waste. The island is a lovely place, and its oversaturated colors give just the right touch to a world that is vaguely fantastical. If Blow had put some variety into the puzzles, preferably using the excellent environment to its fullest, and actually telling a story instead of the lazy minimalistic mess that we got, this title could have been a Myst for a new generation. Instead, it's a dull, frustrating, pointless hike through a lovely, colorful, dead place.

If you’re looking purely for an escape, to turn your mind off and simply enjoy yourself, Night in the Woods very much won’t be for you… at all. If, instead, you view games through the lens of entertainment that can also have something to say or to reveal to you about people who may be living very different lives than you I would absolutely say you should check it out. I don’t know that I’ve ever played a game with characters that remind me so much of my own children, some of their struggles, and how sometimes people’s traits being positives or negatives can be very heavily driven by perspective and context. I can’t think of any game I’ve played in quite some time that made me reflect on as many things as Night in the Woods has, and if you’re open to the experience I’d highly recommend it.",2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,False,bfba5c4bab344751b8ab159a48555209

The stages are somewhat similar to each other, even with procedural generation, and some points in the battle system are truncated, but, overall, the experience is immersive. Other than that, there is an interesting fragmented narrative about a girl with emotional trauma facing relatable situations developed in two gameplay moments that constantly influence each other in a great way — the actions taken while the heroine is awake expand the dream dungeons, and vice versa.

Its pencil-shaded graphics touchingly evoke political cartoons and the dreary, dark colour palate of so much war art to sap life and hope from your course of events. Generally in games, the wonderful efforts put into visuals are to add to your enjoyment, but This War of Mine is instead making use of the medium of art to help put its message across - simultaneously establishing a valid place of its own within. This War of Mine blurs the boundaries of artistic and educational exhibition and in doing so demonstrates, significantly, how effortlessly the medium of videogames can lend itself to much more than entertainment, but if you're looking for fun, you've come to the wrong place. The message here is how fragile humanity can be when the comforts of modern society disappear and a question: Do 'good' and 'bad' choices exist, or just survival of the most ruthless? It's hard to score This War of Mine as a game, because you can't win it. You can survive with enough selfish tact. You can also be more community spirited at your own expense, but then if you die will the community fail without you around anyway? This is a poignant and reflective experience, thought through with meticulous depth.

Besides, the hunt for better equipment and armor sets is just as motivating as in Diablo or Destiny. The bosses are originally designed and many have interesting mechanics. But then there is this balancing, which was only really right for me in a few moments. I like hard games, have played through all the titles from From Software several times since Demon's Souls, and I've also enjoyed defeating titles from other manufacturers - except Lords of the Fallen, which was a bummer. I never had the feeling that the difficulty was so strongly defined by the boss' life energy and my character level as in Nioh 2, which could be compensated by grinding a little bit, but it just doesn't feel quite right. Friends of the genre and the scenario should definitely have a look into the game, because despite all criticism I liked the game.

It has rarely happened to me to face an indie title so well crafted and full of possibilities even in its simplistic realization. But despite all this, it may not be able to conquer everyone, precisely because of this strangeness that may not be appreciated and understood by many. Everhood absolutely doesn’t claim to have the best storyline of the decade, but its purpose must be carefully sought in all the details wisely placed by the Foreign Gnomes inside it, and only in this way the player will be able to access the real ending.

Another proofreading of the script would have helped, too, but the ways in which Everhood builds on and calls back to past titles like Undertale and Earthbound help it rise above its niggling flaws. It's a game of few answers and many questions, chief among them being ""What did I just play?"" and ""What is even happening right now?"" Of course, I mean these as compliments, not strictly statements of bafflement but more of wonder and amazement.

Even if someone used the best noodles possible, the best chocolate syrup, a lavish Lamborghini steering wheel, and a $900 pair of shoes, a lasagne made out of these ingredients wouldn't be very good—even if all the different parts are high quality. Tomb Raider needed someone to stand up and tell the marketing department that disparate gameplay elements weren't going to be shoehorned in simply to increase sales by 0.025%.

While I was disappointed to see a $60 price tag associated with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, I realized after playing it that it is much more than a simple up-rez of a game nearly a year old. The opening moments of 'Tomb Raider' on the PlayStation 4 confirmed for me that the developers at Crystal Dynamics put their heart and soul back into a game they so clearly love. While the updated visuals are quite stunning and, at times jaw-dropping, the gameplay continues to be immersive – with incredible set pieces, high action, acrophobia-inducing platforming, and an interesting story with likable characters. I said it in 2013 when I completed 'Tomb Raider' the first time, and I'll say it again here – 'Tomb Raider' has found a way to give Naughty Dog's 'Uncharted' series a real run for the money, and I can't wait to see where Lara's adventure's lead her next.",2014-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,True,ee7f3c6725fd4fd4b8aeab8622cb770e

The decision you must make is if improved visuals are enough to warrant buying this Definitive Edition. Frankly, I'm convinced that its release is more about profitability on a product that's already crafted than it is about bringing a vastly superior next-generation version of Tomb Raider to the market. For $59.99, it's not that much better than the PS3 version aside from some visual sprucing. Those that have already experienced the game aren't missing much with the Definitive Edition.
