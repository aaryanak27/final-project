While I enjoyed my time with the game I couldn’t help but feel as though I was playing some kind of extended demo. Yeah, it was fun, but it got same-y really quickly. And that is definitely not good when it comes to roguelikes. Would I recommend Defend the Rook? I’m not sure, honestly. I guess I wouldn’t steer you away from it if you wanted to buy it, but, unless they start adding content (which they should because what they have is fun!), I don’t know that I’ll be chomping at the bit to suggest it to people that I talk to.",2022-04-19T00:00:00.000Z,False,c40fb8828f6b45e1ac511f2cc5db9dc2

When I was in the flow of things and somehow magically weaving through all the hazards I was having a terrific time. But I really didn’t like the difficulty spike at the end of this game. It felt a bit like a washing machine cycle where everything is going so well only for the darn thing to break down at the end and leak onto the floor. Sockventure thankfully is not that disastrous and if you like your hard games this will absolutely gel with you. It’s a solid game that feels like a pair of socks I have worn before.

I certainly haven't seen a good part of its possibilities and it's impossible to say what your adventure will be like and this is its greatest merit. Even playing several times, your adventure will always be unique and exclusively yours. Your world is alive and full of color and seeing your actions interfere with the passing of the years makes it all very natural.
