Its heavy material and its dreary art style doesn't make it a game that I plan to revisit very often. I can appreciate the variety of scenarios, especially the idea that players can select different starting points after multiple playthroughs.

It wants to be a classic mystery but never offers up any questions that truly need answering. Twin Mirror wants you to care about its characters but never gives you any reason to even like them. It wants so much to be about its setting but fails to even conjure up a fraction of the sense of place that Arcadia Bay achieved.

While performance on the console absolutely breaks the experience, what little is there to begin with feels lackluster and basic. The creatures and its world are without a doubt the highlight of the game, but even so interaction and creativity in your photography is limited from every angle. I've been a huge proponent of photography video games, but with its surge over the recent years I've realized that I've also become more critical of games wanting to evoke that feeling of photography, but don't seem to fully understand how it can be both a tool for gameplay and creativity. If you're looking for a creative photographic experience I'd recommend titles like Umurangi Generation and (New) Pokémon Snap. Heck even other games that have non-essential photo-modes like Blue Fire, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury and Super Smash Bros.

Unfortunately, even with the good ideas and the framework it feels a bit bland as even with the inclusion of being able to jump and it being part of the exploration, the areas held no mystery of threats of death by those that live within them like Bloodborne, Demons or Dark Souls or the The Surge.

6118aa979d9c7d02ee8a9096,Everyeye.it,Francesco Muccino,65.0,"Once at the end credits the feeling that leaves Foreclosed is that of a missed opportunity, of a good basic idea rendered only half, of the bitter taste in the mouth for what could have been a small, big surprise on the part of the Italian independent scene. Let's be clear, the title signed Antab Studio has arrows to its bow. Using the different cybernetic powers of Evan Kapnos is a pleasure and offer enough variety to the fights, and the cyberpunk atmospheres that you breathe are engaging enough to push you to want to get to the bottom without stopping.",2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,True,e6c849ba687b4ba88ad611428dc5f340
6118aa7f9d9c7d02ee8a9091,PC Invasion,Andrew Farrell,60.0,"While it has a strong premise and some neat ideas, Foreclosed it let down by rote, subpar third-person shooter action and unimpressive stealth sections during its short runtime.",2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,True,e6c849ba687b4ba88ad611428dc5f340
61170f0986af7ace0e7acde8,Sirus Gaming,Rhett Roxl,20.0,"Finishing the game was difficult, not because it had punishing encounters, but because the experience it provides is far from enjoyable. If I didn’t have to review the game, I would have put it down during the first hour. It brought me no enjoyment despite the interesting premise it stands on. As a comic book fan, even its visuals, which is the best part of the game, ultimately failed to engage me because of its terrible gameplay loop. Games are enjoyed for their stimulating gameplay, or their enticing tales, or in the best cases, for both. Foreclosed has neither of those things.",2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,False,e6c849ba687b4ba88ad611428dc5f340

With the symbiote revolver and intuitive hacking, the game has implemented many features successfully. Unfortunately, the repetitive gameplay and sparse environments affect the overall experience. That being said, releasing at a budget price, comic book fans may want to check out this intriguing title.",2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,True,e6c849ba687b4ba88ad611428dc5f340

I can’t fault it for not overstaying. If you want a snappy cyberpunk adventure it might be worth seeing how the story of Evan Kapnos and his fight for his own identity play out.

The game effortlessly makes you feel like you’re in a comic book, and it feels immersive. But while there are some outstanding elements to the game, I just want more of it—more story, more action, more mechanics. Furthermore, I want to see Antab Studio use these same elements to build a longer game with more complexity.",2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,False,e6c849ba687b4ba88ad611428dc5f340

It’s clear the developers were trying to make something cool here, but whether you’re looking for a third person shooter, a cyberpunk game, or a story-heavy game, your time would almost assuredly be better spent elsewhere.

Every system presented to the player works on a functional level, but their implementation simply isn’t up to par with what’s required to make an engaging video game—even one that’s only about four hours long—and this culminates in an experience that ends up being more half-baked than hard-boiled.",2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,False,e6c849ba687b4ba88ad611428dc5f340
