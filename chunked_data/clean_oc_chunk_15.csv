Sure, it's fun enough to play if you can sit down with two of your friends and bash out a couple hours' madness, but I forgot what the game was called once I stopped playing. With next to no lore within the game, and with every win or loss feeling the same, there's just not quite enough to make a lasting impression.",2020-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,True,8185b5be30124bdc93bc46d9174bd114

However, I was pleasantly surprised after I tried it. The combat is simple, yet provides enough depth for on-the-fly strategy changes. Despite the unique concept, much of Spellbreak is rooted in traditional battle royale mechanics, so ultimately the game's success will rely heavily on future content updates.

5f5e1947f7c1f130627f6412,Nintendo Life,Mitch Vogel,70.0,"Spellbreak is up against some pretty tough competition in the ongoing battle for your time and attention, but it's an enjoyable romp that ultimately holds its own. The magic-based combat system proves to feel distinct and interesting next to other genre peers, and you'll find likely yourself eagerly playing matches long into the night once you get a handle on things. That being said, there's an undeniably strong sense of 'vanilla' to Spellbreak that threatens to kill it in its cradle, and that's not even considering the performance problems. Either way, it only costs you some space on your SD card to see what this one's all about, so there's really not much excuse to pass on it. We'd encourage you to give it a download and try it out; this isn't the game to convert you if you don't like battle royales, but it's a respectable example of the genre in action.",2020-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,True,8185b5be30124bdc93bc46d9174bd114

While this tale had promise, the lack of a central villain means that the story also lacks focus and is relegated to the sidelines while the side missions take pride of place. Away from the story, Primal offers hours of other activities that usually involve the game's satisfying melee combat and a beast from the game's rather fun taming mechanic. Players are never left with nothing to do, but it's for how long players will persist before the game starts to feel a bit too repetitive. This doesn't mean that it is a bad game by any means, especially when offering 40-50 hours of gameplay before reaching 100% completion.

Gameplay, music and the voice actors make you overlook the graphics and enjoy the video game. Personally, I haven't been a fan of German dubbing before, but Far Cry 6 simply delivers and has convinced me to play in German more often.

Hopefully there will be some fixes from the developer in the short term, because the permanent respawns of the enemies are quite annoying. In addition, the AI should get a little boost in general. The enemies are simply stupid and only very rarely a challenge at all. In the first few hours I had already found a handful of bugs and kept stumbling across new problems.
