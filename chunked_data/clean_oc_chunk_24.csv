The gameplay is enjoyable on the harder difficulties and stays just long enough to not wear out its welcome. Speedrunners or Achievement Hunters should rejoice as the game has plenty available for those seeking the perfect run. Perhaps a leaderboard will be added to it in the future that gives them, even more, to go after.

While it doesn't disrupt the genre or innovate upon it in unique ways, it's an acceptable new indie with a ton of heart and soul that was ever-present through the 13 levels. Although the game is admittedly short and could use a bit more variety in its level design, I can't say I didn't enjoy myself. The slight hints of new level ideas in later levels gave me help for further developments with this game that never came but did ultimately give me a glimmer of what future games from this developer could bring.

However, as much as terrorising beach goers and snatching hunters from the bows of their fishing boats is a pretty good time, and as much as we enjoyed watching our orphaned bull shark grow from helpless pup to apex predator, the whole thing is let down by poor combat and the very worst kind of busywork side quests.

Other than photographing a lot of dogs – so many, many dogs – there’s almost nothing else to do. While it remains charming and silly throughout, you’re not able to form any sort of lasting bond with any of these dogs. Your interactions with them are too fleeting, too inconsequential.

Sailing the seven seas with a crew of salty sea dogs, taking on a pair of angry French frigates is just fun. Sneaking through the bushes at a governors' soiree, then sneakily shooting one of his guards with a berserk dart and watching him slaughter all of his erstwhile comrades - that's always good for a giggle. You can feel the swagger when you first buy the captain's uniform and cut a dashing figure through the streets of the colonies.

My favorite part is right at the start.

In the prologue, you get to see Ao and Bo having their first proper (drunken) conversation. It is exactly like watching yourself in your twenties – going from ‘I barely know you’ to ‘let’s have an incredibly deep philosophical conversation about the meaning of life’ in about thirty seconds. You get to see them click together, a fledgling friendship right at the start. And it’s really nice to watch.

Do their conversations become a bit pretentious and self-centered? Well, yeah, sometimes. But then again, I think I remember being like that in my early twenties, too.

Overall, it was a surprisingly emotionally complex game, but a lot shorter than I’d liked. Still, I’d recommend giving it a go if you’re after a new indie game for the Switch.",2021-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,False,c44ed0a965cc43b98425d5d7437796d5

Raji: An Ancient Epic proves it is worthy of its title. It is often easy to think of an indie title as good looking; or with masterful platforming segments in levels that make sense given the story.

At its core, gameplay may be uninteresting, but this entire facet allows for something way more important: world building. Raji also finds an incredible boon in its excellent voice over work and sound design, which is especially true for supporting characters like Durgu. Where Raji absolutely shines, however, is in its exceptional narrative. It combines level design and storytelling in beautiful ways that not only teaches, but also moves the plot forward.

There is a handy tutorial to set you on your way but be warned, you will lose many days if not months of your life to this game in order to perfect your farm.  As a father of 4 boys I would personally struggle to sit down every day for a few hours to carry on what I was doing from the day before.  That said this is the perfect form of escapism if you just need to go chill and take time out from your life, which let’s face it, we should all do from time to time.  The attention to detail within the game as well as the amazing CLAAS vehicles that have been included in this edition really bring something to the table if you love your farming and engineering.

Well, no, it's not so surprising, really - it already was addictive 40 years ago, even on Atari 2600, so it would be hard for it to not be so on the Switch.
