The Kickstarter campaign proclaims “It’s like opening a dusty old desk drawer and finding an undiscovered LucasArts adventure game you’ve never played before.” I would go a step further and say it’s as if Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, the creators of “Thimbleweed Park” and pioneers behind masterpieces such as “Maniac Mansion” and “Monkey Island,” challenged themselves to make something they could hypothetically take on a time machine back to the late 80s and introduce with minimal disruption to the future.

I would strongly encourage most gamers to check this out. With the use of Tonics, you’re able to tailor the experience to your ability level, so really it’s hard to turn it down.

It's easy to get lost in a flow state while traversing between cubes to switches and other cubes, imbibing in the phenomenal, ever building soundtrack. It has none of the script or context of a title like Portal, but one would easily suspect that that would conflict with the undiluted audio-visual treat that this experience proffers. Manifold Garden builds a compelling, meditative world, and easily stands on its own merit as a highly recommended first person puzzle. It is short but sweet, as they say, and paced excellently.

I wasn’t expecting a serious plot between the zany happenings, yet the creative narrative kept me playing right until the end when everything started to finally make sense to me. Yuppie Psycho had so many great little touches which helped it stand out from the crowd, for me it was the fact you have to investigate and learn your foes patterns in order to survive, rather than running at them with a weapon. Although I found the save function a bit annoying, there should be no problem finding enough resources within the game.

That being said, I can easily recommend Yuppie Psycho to anyone who appreciates an atmospheric horror game with a nice plot, great character building, adorable artwork and soundtracks which will give you goosebumps.

61311eb93b0d5cbd8095fe25,Shacknews,TJ Denzer,80.0,"Owlcat Games captured the creative freedom and magic of tabletop RPG adventure in a way few others do. There is such a good story here with characters and music that really push the desperation of survival in this game’s world. And you get to answer to the ongoing narrative with a character you can truly make your own both before the game begins and throughout the adventure. I wish it wasn’t so unforgiving in its information or that it didn’t deviate so much from the adventure with the Crusade Management, but you can also tone down the challenge at will and automate much of that system to breeze through. Take that for what it is and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is one of the most enjoyable choice-driven tactical RPGs I’ve played.",2021-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,True,c9e2e1970b1f4773a7992a3760a43323
