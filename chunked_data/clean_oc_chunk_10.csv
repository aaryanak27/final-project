Fast-paced combat, a memorable setting, and a surprisingly content-rich open world make for an experience that action-RPG fans won't want to miss out on. Were it not for the performance issues, we might even be inclined to say this is the best example of the genre on the Switch yet.

More bosses (hidden or otherwise), more characters, even more levels.

Or any plot, really. The game is charming, but it would be more so if I knew what the hell was going on. That said, it’s still very addictive and I would highly recommend it to fans of platformers. It provided at least 10 hours of gameplay for only $17.99, and that’s without unlocking 100% of the items.
