Sloclap has crafted an astounding, rewarding experience, one that serves up engrossing combat and intricate visual / music direction to accompany each fist of fury. Even with only five levels to beat, this doesn’t mean there isn’t any nuance or sense of scope to them. Every level is filled with vibrant atmospheres that sell the notion of a kung-fu adventure.

Just like our experience with Returnal, we find ourselves in front of a product that, besides marking the maturity of its development team, departs from all those clichés indispensable to grab the largest number of users and stands only on its originality and on the skill of its creators in packaging a title that does not give discounts and does not compromise. Sifu is a collection of genres that come together in a satisfying game, punishing in some ways but never unfair. It's a celebration of beat 'em ups, and martial arts cinema, adorned with a distinctive and inspired artwork that exudes style from every pixel. We're sure it won't appeal to everyone who tries it, but it's only right that it should, to avoid a general flattening of the experience that titles like Sifu want to keep varied and, above all, original.

That time spent listening to player feedback was used wisely, and balancing, tone, and innovation have all been tweaked with a deft hand. While some of its elements shine more brightly than others, and the more involved nature of the game means it's a tougher sell for players looking to rapid-fire their way through its learning curve and combinations, Trials of Fire leaves Early Access as yet another strong, captivating deckbuilding game that borrows from tabletop roleplaying games and roguelites to carve out a name for itself.",2021-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,True,6e57639bc193428d892a39cb86effe13

It is enhanced by also acting like a rouguelike for endless replayability, and it crafts a rich world around its characters. Trials of Fire only disappoints on one front: that the story it actually tells seems more like a teaser than an epic.

I found myself having fun and easily knew what to do to prevent dying, even if I still occasionally got overran. Unfortunately, a lot of this hinges on how much of a deal-breaker farming is.

There are numerous moments here that are truly alive to the strangeness of this world that might have truly inspired our awe, even our empathy for the characters, if we weren’t also being saddled with the frustration of wondering when the game is going to get on with the program. The payoff for the player’s patience isn’t without its power, but it’s also a bit of a missed opportunity.

The biggest highlight is the setting: the locations are fascinating and full of unusual and charismatic characters. The stunning pixel art look and attention to detail bring the world to life, making it very immersive. As an adventure, the game offers snippets of exploration punctuated by puzzles and combats in which we alternate between two protagonists to advance. The dungeons are nice, but the simplicity and repetition of the mechanics makes them uncomfortable after a while. The real focus is on narrative with numerous non-interactive scenes and a story full of mysteries. Unfortunately, the balance is not good, resulting in too many drawn-out moments and dialogues that barely develop the plot. Even so, Eastward manages to transport us to a peculiar universe with its exceptional setting.
