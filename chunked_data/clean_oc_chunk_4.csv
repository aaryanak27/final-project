It's retro sensibilities have allowed it to age flawlessly, making it just as compelling to play now as it was upon initial release.

The characters all feel real and they drive the player to find the truth before the Golden Rule is broken and the loop must reset. The developers have been careful to create a narrative that, while repetitive in practice, still keeps the player engaged in the wider narrative of the world through exploration and discovery.

Also the gameplay is fun in itself. The commands of the characters are intuitive and you won't find a nested menu navigation. 

If you look at the DLC, you can get an enormous extension of the game fun with about 10 Euro. New classes, a guild system that makes sense and tameable monsters. What more do you want?
