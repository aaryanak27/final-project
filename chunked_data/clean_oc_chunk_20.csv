617ed9da62d1a35f154f30b9,NookGaming,Isaiah Parker,70.0,"I still recommend the game. Beneath all the baggage that the Ultimate version introduces, it’s still fantastic after so long. Despite having played the Switch version in particular, which is much worse off than the other versions, I still enjoyed the game enough to 100% in less than half a day. While I don’t regret my time doing so, by the end of it, I was slightly disheartened. Disheartened that, despite all the promises Sega made about ensuring more quality Sonic experiences, these promises end up coming out feeling like half-truths. I can only hope that future Sonic re-releases and remasters, including the upcoming Sonic Origins, have more time and care put into them, as the series truly does deserve better.",2021-11-03T00:00:00.000Z,False,a400d19a077240729e9944c75f4db31a

This game was considered a hidden gem back in the day, but really is just one of the better 3D Sonic games.

The one caveat being that Eggman is powering his theme park with captured aliens called Wisps.

However, I didn't expect any quantum leaps either, but those who do might get a rude awakening. Sonic Colours Ultimate is a robust remaster with slight additions - nothing more, nothing less. If you liked the original and want to experience the whole thing again, you can grab it, and newcomers should also have fun with the port.

The Sonic series continues to struggle with finding a way to incorporate gameplay hooks that don’t amount to shallow, pointless gimmicks, but in Colors SEGA discovered the perfect mix. With Ultimate, that balance has been restored for a new generation of players to experience. Hopefully, SEGA takes cues from Ultimate as it works on that mysterious upcoming 3D Sonic sequel.

The 3D sections are far and few between, but the ones that are there are fun. The 2D gameplay is vastly improved from Sonic Generations with tighter controls and added variety in the form of Wisp abilities. Ultimate adds a lick of new paint to bring this to the Xbox platform, of which it is recommended to play on either Xbox Series X|S to get the standard performance that players have come to expect. Rival Rush is a fun mode, but there are only six acts and some of these levels are incredibly short.

It's just a shame that a few major glitches and pacing issues really hold it back from reaching its full potential. With Bunnyhug still hard at work with fixes, we just hope it gets closer to that apex we wanted to see it reach.

It is exactly aimed at that kind of player, while also being quite accessible to new players and charming enough along the way to get you invested in exploring each level.

Its biggest highlight is due to the rich mythology that was created for the game, along with a gameplay that is both challenging and rewarding. A sure recommendation only for long-time veterans of the genre.",2022-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,False,398144371e664e3785069448ed6589aa

It won’t stay with you or leave a lasting impression other than fatigue. It might have been a better game if it were 25 hours instead of 60; that way it could condense its best aspects into a reasonable package.",2022-02-07T00:00:00.000Z,True,398144371e664e3785069448ed6589aa

It remains at the gates of the outstanding because I consider that there are some points where a bit of braking is passed when it comes to demanding the player, which will cause many players to find themselves with insurmountable barriers.",2022-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,False,398144371e664e3785069448ed6589aa

There’s still plenty to appreciate and enjoy if that’s up your alley, but it doesn’t do enough to allow its concept to stand out from the competition.",2022-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,False,398144371e664e3785069448ed6589aa

The game has a solid foundation, but its individual elements don't provide a concise experience as a whole. There is always something unnecessary that tests the player's patience and perseverance beyond what is necessary. In the end, it is a title that will remain in memory not for what it is, but for what it could have been.",2022-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,True,398144371e664e3785069448ed6589aa

61e7896f9e5c48c548d6e47c,Checkpoint Gaming,Tom Quirk,80.0,"Aeterna Noctis is an amazing example of how a developer can mix together gameplay elements from many popular platformers of the past few years to construct something greater than the sum of its parts. While it owes a gameplay debt to games like Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, and Castlevania, Aeterna Noctis’ fascinating setting and enjoyable gameplay make it easy to appreciate on its own. Its beautiful world and gorgeous soundtrack make exploring Aeterna is a joy, even when its high difficulty is knocking you down over and over. If you’ve been seeking your next Metroidvania fix, Aeterna Noctis is definitely worth diving into.",2021-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,False,398144371e664e3785069448ed6589aa
