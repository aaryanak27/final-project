Drinkbox took a big risk releasing this game on on the Vita but it takes full advantage and is probably the best use of the touchscreen to date. The combat is so satisfying, the world so beautiful and fun to explore, and the music and sound effects so great to listen to.

Despite the strongly linear structures and the half-open, lifeless areas, The Outer Worlds indisputably follows in the big AAA footsteps of the Fallout franchise without embarrassing itself. Thanks to the great variance of decision possibilities and the deeply rooted moral system, the American studio also enhances the marginal complexity behind the role-playing construct, which above all benefits the narrative with its humorous touch and entertaining social criticism. Obsidian Entertainment simply relies on the player as an unforeseen variable to counter repetitive influences.
