It smartly puts its focus purely on the act of gathering materials to create a wide range of objects, with little else to distract from the core crafting mechanic. It's backed up by a great soundtrack and a reasonably well-told but ultimately forgettable tale as you trawl through the various areas searching for ingredients. Trying to locate specific items can at times feel exhausting and drags down the pacing of the game, and the gorgeous visuals are unfortunately hampered by a slight frame rate jitter.

But Wytchwood does let the player down with such a vague and uninteresting story. A game needs a hook, and this story ain’t it. Crafting games make me uniquely aware of how much time I am wasting by playing them. But in the end, I like to look back at the little work of art I made by building a house, or a city, or a space station. In Wytchwood I am just collecting ingredients because the game told me to collect those ingredients.

It is also a great choice for those who enjoy crafting and survival games, but prefer to have questlines to follow instead of self-governed gameplay. While the 2D art style is fun and reminiscent of storybook illustrations, this game is likely not the best pick for younger players due to questlines dealing with horror elements, as well as graphic depictions of animal death when using traps and lures.

I say ‘simple’ because there’s not been that many enhancements outside of the visuals. Sure, we get a perfect 60fps, a crystal clear 4k, and the heavenly ‘turbo mode’ which makes traversing the world so much more satisfying, but there’s no extra content, no new chapters, no enhanced backstory, or platform-specific dungeons/areas to visit.
However, a game isn’t as good as it looks, it’s as good as it plays; The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel is a bloody brilliant JRPG game which I’m quite ashamed I’ve never actually played before grabbing it on the PS4. The story is very interesting, with lots of separate stories and events going on which all combinate into an intriguing and exciting narrative, combined with very satisfying and strategic combat. The combat itself may look generic and simple from the outside, but once you’ve cranked up the difficulty to eleven, it’s time to turn on your little grey cells as you swap your students on the fly and link them together in order to maximise their efficiency.",2019-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,False,ac7a008ed2324f8f91559d734da70610

There's a load of promise from the Disrupt engine and the game license itself. The story of Aiden Pearce is money well spent, even if the buildup doesn't get nearly the payoff one would expect. The little added bonuses feel tad bit gimmicky, but up until recently, Ubisoft never tried to heavily promote them as selling points. What a future 'Watch Dogs' game needs to work on are its driving physics and its graphics; there isn't a reason why the next game should begin to match expectations of the E3 demo; what gamers have been offered here maybe lacking in sheer 'wow' factor, but had that demo never been as stunning as it was, I'd argue the end product might have been received more favorably.",2014-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,True,57001074e2cf4d048839e4a2ebb44d71

With this I want to clarify that this is not a brand new installment in the franchise but more like a standalone expansion pack. It brings period weapons, equipment and vehicles into a Red Orchestra setting. Rising Storm 2 features 2 factions with 2 sub groups in each, the USMC, US Army, NVA, and Viet Cong forces. With the amount of factions, I did expect a few more gear options, here I found a small lack in gearing choices. I would have liked a few more weapons and choices here. The game also offers you cosmetic choices in the form of clothing options, camo, helmets, tattoos and more.

It’s a big game too, full of variety and pleasantly light on filler. My playthrough took around 40 hours and I still have plenty of side-content to go back to and I probably will (which is far from common for me). It borrows from the best including BotW but also brings a scattering of new ideas and let’s not overlook this, it’s available on all platforms for everyone to enjoy.

A setting which is fascinating and beautiful at the same time. The huge world just screams ""Explore me, experience me"", and I followed this scream with skin and hair. I found myself swinging onto my blue horse and just riding around in the area, simply because I liked the surroundings so much.

The urge to explore is satisfied throughout the whole game and leaves nothing to be desired. If you want to do dungeons, no problem. If you want to improve the health bar of Fenyx, well, then you just have to look for it. You can invest more than a hundred hours in the game without getting really bored.
