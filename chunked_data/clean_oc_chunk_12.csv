5d867c6a93765d677879140b,Digitally Downloaded,Matt Sainsbury,50.0,"Horizon Chase Turbo does a good job of creating a sense of speed, and emulating the look and feel of Out Run. Where it falls down is in replacing the timer mechanics of Out Run, which made for a frustrating but ultimately exciting and tense arcade game, with a more typical racing track structure. It plays fine, but with none of the intensity, nor sense of reward, of the game it pulls almost all of its inspiration from.

Not only does it look and perform great, aside from a lack of online multiplayer it really offers up everything you could ask for and more. Incentives to return to unlock new areas, tracks, sweet rides, and upgrades is fair motivation, matching your times against buddies or the world are icing on the cake. While it may offend the sensibilities of more modern racing fans who have a taste for realism, I’m happy to say the spirit of Out Run and its contemporaries is alive and well in this outstanding title that’s chock full of terrific content.",2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,False,58a2b650955f4920876afe86dfb563c1

The story is a nice touch by falls flat. The tracks can be innovative but become generic. The mini-games are interesting but shallow. Everything in Trials Fusion is just an inch away from being awesome but, much like a botched motorcycle jump, ends up falling into a pit instead… a pit called mediocrity. Trials Fusion is fun enough, if only because it gives you a chance to return to the Trials gameplay you know and love, but it's easily the weakest of all three Trials titles.

Before I knew it, I had captured all three of the escaped fears, and my journey was over. I found myself wishing there were more to the ending. But there isn’t.
But as I’ve stated numerous times in this review, Figment isn’t really here to make you think too hard. The subject matter makes it seem like there should be more weight to everything, but its chill pace contradicts this.
While it can be too slow at times, with its leisurely pace and cool music, it’s up to the player to decide if they think the game is “chill” or whether it’s shallow of content. And as I wished for more challenge at times, both in content and message, I wavered between the two. And ultimately, that’s what’s on my mind.",2019-05-14T04:00:00.000Z,False,addd4e86c4d746ab86f21606bdadce7d

From my personal point of view, Limbic Entertainment delivered a great game on their Tropico debut. Graphically, it is a treat thanks to the Unreal Engine. Untypical for the genre it is possible to rotate the camera completely free, tilt it and zoom extremely close. The sound and the background music are also very nice.

The processes under the hood are logical and, unlike in the beta, not very faulty or comprehensible for the player. The merchandise system and the production chains are obvious and conclusive even for beginners.
Nevertheless, despite the very good tutorial, there will be a lot of learning and frustration for newcomers to the series or even genre. The wealth of buildings, as well as the dictatorial and diplomatic possibilities are immense. This mass can be quite overwhelming for one or the other. But since Penúltimo and the other characters present the whole thing with a lot of humor, the fun is at least for me not lost at any time.

Especially in the later course of the game it gets confusing very quickly due to the large number of participants (superpowers and factions). I personally have to take a break more often and sort the events for me.
But this does not harm the game.

A big weak point is the character creation, if you followed the review carefully you will notice that it wasn't mentioned before. And not without reason, it is simply unimaginative and boring, almost boring. This was always one of the biggest strengths in the previous reviews. Here Limbic was just sleeping, maybe they also ran out of time.

Except for the small weaknesses in road building and the wasted potential in character creation and palace adaptation, Tropico 6 is a typical Tropico. Very simple thing. A class (Tropico) debut of the Hessians. For my part, I will now go back to the Caribbean in my mind. ¡Nos vemos!",2019-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,False,1911ccf15b3d4508a6e195b31eee1372
