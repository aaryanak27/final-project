The lack of guidance in the beginning and the learning curve can be tough for new players to acclimatise to. However, after a few hours of learning, some of the frustration drops away, and the game becomes more fun because the player starts honing their skills. Trying to take down the Ravenii as quickly as possible to save the city before rushing to the next giant can be stressful, but it is an enjoyable kind of stress. Similarly, facing off against two or more Ravenii can be a fun challenge, forcing different strategies, such as attacking the more weakly armored first or severing a leg so the player can focus their attention on the other ogre. The problems that hold Extinction back may be a make-it-or-break-it point for some players. The inconsistency in using the whip can bring exasperation, and the lack of varied game modes can become boring. Furthermore, the predominantly single-button combat system is lackluster because far greater complexity can easily be envisioned for a game of this type. Having more ways to perform sweeping attacks for crowd control or stronger direct attacks might make the physical act of play more enjoyable. With more varied game modes, a more in-depth combat system, and redesigned traversal mechanics, Extinction could stand out, but, in its current state, it simply exists.",2018-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,False,0a687e1cf9c44f2dab63efb4afc4b140
