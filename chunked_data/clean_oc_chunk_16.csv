The amazing attention to detail and unknowing nature of each mission will resonate deeply with 40k fans and be a good starting point for newcomers to the franchise. Personally, I would have loved to have seen more factions engaged in battle but introducing the Sisters of Battle as reinforcements has been a clever way to expand the list of units available without straying away from the deep lore that the game is set in. Although I wouldn't call 'Battlesector' a difficult game, it does pose quite the challenge for players of all skill levels.

The player takes on the role of V, a merc who wants to make it big, in a living and breathing city with a life of its own.

This is enhanced by unique game mechanics for each faction within the game, though there are sadly a limited number, as well as adding mechanics that all factions work with like the favour of gods. This is backed up by a brilliant resource and city-management system, making this one of the more strategic Total War titles out there. There are some flaws, such as agents mostly feeling useless and a few small niggles with diplomacy and allied AI, but these are outshone by the aforementioned positives and a fantastically tactical combat system due to enhanced units and new terrain, as well as mythical units.
