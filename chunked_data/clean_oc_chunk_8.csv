So Switch players are getting this game in its most evolved form, with a roster that's pushing three figures and a vast number of modes to unlock and enjoy. It does have a higher difficulty curve than the likes of Arena of Valor, and there's a slow grind to earn skins via the Season Pass, but the game itself is one of the best entries in the genre and it's right here on Switch – a cause for celebration and no mistake.

The action-adventure hardly brings any innovation to the busy genre, but clearly creates a certain uniqueness due to its discrepant structure. The cuddly Pixar look meets a darker, clearly more grown-up narrative as well as an (over)demanding battle scene, which nevertheless never manages to lose you on a motivational level. In combination with the clearly digestible gameplay and the really successful technical implementation, the action adventure manages to emancipate itself from its indie niche and fights its way into the relevance range of its AAA competition. Minimal lapses like the miserable focus system or minor frame drops are forgiven for the entertaining adventure, of course. What remains in the end is not only an animation studio that has skillfully proven how a holistic vision can liquidate a lack of experience, but has also given us the second reason to own a PlayStation home console in September.

About combat and how mechanically beautiful it is. About how beautiful the game itself is. About how gratifying it is to pull together a crazy set of cards and come out on top. About how there’s little narrative but each attempt becomes a sort of micro-story through the shaping of the team and deck. About the way each character’s distinct strategies and personality are built into their cards. But really it comes down to this; if you like deck-builders or ever have, you should give Roguebook a chance. Tainted Grail: Conquest isn’t for everyone and I knew that right away, even if I loved that game in its own way. Roguebook is one that everyone with even a passing interest should try.

The combat system is well fleshed out, the map exploration is fun and thought provoking, and the game isn't purely reliant on luck to get you through. While you probably won't be doing a lot of runs in one sitting, each run is short enough to not feel like a drag, and you can save your progress and leave to come back to it later, or just abandon the run altogether if you need to.

You can feel the inspiration from earlier deck-builders, but it’s very much its own thing. Unique combat mechanics, gorgeous visuals, and addicting exploration make for a roguelike deck-builder that’s polished and keeps you going back for more. And you’ll definitely want to go back for more and more, as you’ll unlock additional cards and skills that will help your future runs. I’d also like to note that the developers received some pretty heavy criticism for making what seemed like a fairly significant chunk of game into DLC that was available the same day as release. In what I thought was an integrity move, they announced that they’ll be releasing the Apex Predator Pack for free, and anybody who purchased it can request a refund.

While I might think Slay the Spire has that edge on the given mechanics and strategies of a single run, I believe RogueBook excels at world building, game progression, and re-playablity as new power-ups, characters, cards, map items, and challenges are unlocked not just on every run but especially after successfully completing the core game. Each is excellent, each game deserves to be enjoyed.

The world captivates with its elaborate fantasy setting, and the mechanics of drawing paths on the map bring freedom to matches.
